# Credits/History
In the beginning, there was the [Marty Goodman Document](http://www.club100.org/library/ups/tpdd.do), and it was good.

More recently, Rick Shear has taken a new and very careful look at a real cable, and the Marty Goodman doc, and has probably identified the "mystery" components that Marty Goodman talks about. It looks right, and this circuit does indeed work.<br>

This cable uses the same transistors, but a different physical construction.
