TTL-RS232 level-shifting cable for Tandy Portable Disk Drive

This version has a cable that ends in a male 25-pin plug to connect to a "Model T"s female 25-pin DTE RS-232 port.  
This is the same as the original cable that came with the drive.

# Version for TANDY WP-2 and most PC's

The only difference to this version is the cable ends in a 9-pin female plug to connect to a 9-pin male DTE RS-232 port.  
This fits the TANDY WP-2, and also most modern PC's and usb-serial adapters.

# Version for Cambridge Z88

The only difference to this version is the cable ends in a 9-pin male plug with custom pinout.  
This fits the Cambridge Z88.  
*The Cambridge Z88 RS-232 port has a non-standard pinout.*
*Do not connect this cable to other PC's or devices.*

# Credits / History
In the beginning, there was the [Marty Goodman Document](http://www.club100.org/library/ups/tpdd.do), and it was good.

More recently, Rick Shear has taken a new and very careful look at a real cable, and the Marty Goodman doc, and has probably identified the "mystery" components that Marty Goodman talks about. It looks right, and hist circuit does indeed work.<br>

This cable uses the same transistors, but a different physical construction.
