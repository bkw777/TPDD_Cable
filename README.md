In the beginning, there was the [ftp://salsa.net/pub/M100SIG/Lib-09-PERIFERALS/TPDD.DO Marty Goodman Document], and it was good.

More recently, Rick Shear has taken a new and very careful look at a real cable, and the Marty Goodman doc, and has probably identified the "mystery" components that Marty Goodman talks about. It looks right, and hist circuit does indeed work.

This cable uses the same transistors, but a different physical construction.
